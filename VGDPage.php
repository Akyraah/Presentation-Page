			Each class has its own items : one specific weapon with its own characteristics and special objects 
			which can be placed to help your team take the lead. Those items range from a simple block the player can placed to either hamper the enemy team or create new opportunities
			to a shovel and a camera.
			<br> <span class="tab"></span> Thanks to those classes, the attacking team may chose to reach the safe from above using a zip-line, dig a long and undetected tunnel across the map or simply rush fully armed.
			<br> <span class="tab"></span> Finally, each player may only see what he and his team can see in front of them, so that the strategy chosen by their enemies remain hidden until they discover it.
